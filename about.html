                    <p>Hi, I'm Lu. I built this website because I am regularly asked for advice on visiting Japan by friends and family overseas, and noticed that most of their images of Japan come from the same few places and the same few things. Tokyo, Sushi, Kyoto, certain events in recent history... So, I wanted to share some of the knowledge and experiences I have built up over the decades.</p>
                    
                    <p>I'm from the UK and first came here in 2006. I lived in Tokyo for three years, a great place for your early twenties, and of course visited Kyoto and all the usual spots early on, but came to realise that the parts of the country I most loved were elsewhere. I left Japan. lived around the world, came back, left again, came back, and then what was supposed to be another short stay turned into something permanent. I lived in a couple of different cities for a year or two but then, and for the last decade, in the countryside of Fukushima. It was never the plan, but I ended up building a family and a house here.</p>

                    <h2>Why This Website Exists</h2>
                    <p>When my friends visit, they have a great time, but they often want to do the same tourist trail. They see the famous spots, but it's busy (and getting busier), and relatively expensive. Imagine Japan - what's your image? Serene temples, relaxed dining, fun and exciting nightlife? Then you need to get away from the usual spots. The goal of this site is simple: to give you practical information so you can get off the beaten track and experience your own Japan.</p>
                    
                    <h2>What Makes This Site Different</h2>
                    <p>The advice here comes from years of living in Japan, having a blast, then building a career, a home, a family, and eventually realising this is now my home. It's about traveling but also the practical stuff - how to navigate daily life, what things actually cost, how to deal with situations you won't read about in a guidebook. It's the information I share with friends.</p>
                    
                    <p>Thanks for reading. I hope the information here is genuinely useful for your visit to this awesome country.</p>
