                    <p>If there's one thing you're guaranteed to see in Japan, it's a convenience store, or <strong>コンビニ (konbini)</strong>. They are everywhere: on busy city corners, in quiet residential neighborhoods, and even in remote rural areas. But these aren't your average convenience stores. They are renowned for a reason, and they will likely become a cornerstone of your visit.</p>
                    <p>The magic of the konbini lies in its incredible blend of convenience and quality. You can find everything you need for daily living—from toilet paper and pens to shirts and umbrellas. But for the traveler on the go, the real attraction is the food. They offer an amazing array of fresh, delicious, and cheap meals: bento boxes, onigiri (rice balls), sandwiches, fried chicken, and high-quality packaged goods and drinks. They're a 24/7 lifeline for a quick breakfast, a cheap lunch, or a late-night snack.</p>

                    <h2>The Big Three: What to Know</h2>
                    <p>While there are many chains, the market is dominated by three giants. They might seem similar at first, but each has its own personality and is known for slightly different things.</p>
    
                    <div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3 gap-8 my-12 not-prose">
                        <!-- 7-Eleven -->
                        <div class="bg-white p-6 rounded-lg shadow-md border-t-4 border-red-500">
                            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3">7-Eleven</h3>
                            <p class="text-gray-600">Often considered the king of konbini, 7-Eleven is praised for its high-quality, original brand products. It's particularly famous for its excellent coffee machine, a wide variety of bento boxes, and a wide variety of sandwiches, some standard and some strange (whipped cream and strawberry sandwich, anyone?)</p>
                        </div>
                        <!-- FamilyMart -->
                        <div class="bg-white p-6 rounded-lg shadow-md border-t-4 border-green-500">
                            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3">FamilyMart</h3>
                            <p class="text-gray-600">FamilyMart is a close competitor known for its fantastic hot food selection, especially its fried chicken, famously called "FamiChiki." They also have a great variety of breads, pastries, and desserts.</p>
                        </div>
                        <!-- Lawson -->
                        <div class="bg-white p-6 rounded-lg shadow-md border-t-4 border-blue-500">
                            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3">Lawson</h3>
                            <p class="text-gray-600">Lawson stands out for its desserts, especially the Uchi Café Sweets line which often features premium roll cakes and puddings. They are also known for their "Kara-age Kun," bite-sized fried chicken nuggets that come in various flavors.</p>

                    <h3>Other Chains You Might See</h3>
                    <p>While the big three are everywhere, keep an eye out for others. <strong>Ministop</strong> is unique because it has a small kitchen and seating area where they prepare fast food like soft-serve ice cream and hot dogs. <strong>Daily Yamazaki</strong> is run by the Yamazaki baking company, so they have an excellent selection of fresh bread and sandwiches. You may also hear older residents mention <strong>Circle K Sunkus</strong>, which was a major chain before it was completely absorbed by FamilyMart in 2018.</p>

                    <h2>A Traveler's Guide to Using a Konbini</h2>
                    <p>Here are a few practical tips to make your konbini experience smooth:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Heating food:</strong> When you buy a bento or pasta, the cashier will often ask "温めますか？" (Atatamemasu ka? - "Should I heat this?"). A simple "はい, お願いします" (Hai, onegaishimasu - "Yes, please") will get you a hot meal.</li>
                        <li><strong>Coffee Machine:</strong> To get coffee, you typically take a cup from the freezer section to the counter, pay for it, and then operate the machine yourself. It’s usually a simple one-button press.</li>
                        <li><strong>Paying:</strong> They accept cash, all major credit cards, and IC cards (like Suica or Pasmo).</li>
                    </ul>
