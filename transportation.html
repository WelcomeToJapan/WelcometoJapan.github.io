                    <!-- Section 1: The Japan Rail Pass -->
                    <h3>The Japan Rail (JR) Pass</h3>
                    <p>The JR Pass is a special, cost-effective rail pass for foreign tourists, allowing unlimited travel on most JR trains for a set period. It's the single biggest transportation decision for many visitors. The pass covers all JR Group railwaysâ€”including Shinkansen (except Nozomi and Mizuho), limited express, local trains, and some buses and ferries.</p>
                    
                    <div class="bg-red-50 border-l-4 border-red-500 p-6 rounded-r-lg my-8">
                        <h4 class="mt-0">Is the JR Pass Worth It For You?</h4>
                        <p>Since the price increase in October 2023, the pass is no longer a "no-brainer" for everyone. It's now best for travelers taking multiple long-distance Shinkansen trips. Ask yourself:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><i data-lucide="check" class="inline-block w-5 h-5 text-green-600 mr-2"></i>Am I traveling long distances, like Tokyo &rarr; Kyoto &rarr; Hiroshima and back?</li>
                            <li><i data-lucide="check" class="inline-block w-5 h-5 text-green-600 mr-2"></i>Do I value convenience and flexibility over booking individual tickets?</li>
                            <li><i data-lucide="x" class="inline-block w-5 h-5 text-red-600 mr-2"></i>Am I mostly staying in one city or region (e.g., just Tokyo and Hakone)?</li>
                            <li><i data-lucide="x" class="inline-block w-5 h-5 text-red-600 mr-2"></i>Am I using the Nozomi or Mizuho trains? (These fastest trains require a supplemental fee with the pass.)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Rule of Thumb:</strong> If the cost of your individual long-distance tickets adds up to more than the price of the pass, it's worth it. Use a <a href="#">JR Pass Calculator</a> to check.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h4>How to Buy and Use the JR Pass</h4>
                    <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2 pl-4">
                        <li><strong>Buy Online Before Your Trip:</strong> You must purchase an "Exchange Order" from an authorized online vendor before you arrive in Japan. <a href="https://japanrailpass.net/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Buy your official JR rail pass here</a>.</li>
                        <li><strong>Receive Your Exchange Order:</strong> This physical voucher will be mailed to your home address. Don't lose it!</li>
                        <li><strong>Activate in Japan:</strong> Once you arrive, take your Exchange Order and your passport to a JR office (found at airports and major train stations) to trade it for the actual pass.</li>
                        <li><strong>Reserve Seats:</strong> While you can hop on most non-reserved cars, it's highly recommended to reserve your seats on long-distance trains for free at a ticket office or machine.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <!-- Section 2: Local City Transit -->
                    <h3>Mastering Local Transit: The IC Card</h3>
                    <p>For subways, local buses, and even vending machines, an IC Card is your best friend. These rechargeable smart cards make city travel incredibly simple.</p>
                    <div class="flex flex-col md:flex-row gap-6 items-center bg-gray-100 p-6 rounded-lg">
                        <img src="images/train5.jpg" alt="Suica or Pasmo IC Card" class="w-48 rounded-lg shadow-md">
                        <div>
                            <h4 class="mt-0">Your Key to the City</h4>
                            <p>The main IC cards are <strong>Suica</strong> (from JR East, mainly Tokyo) and <strong>Pasmo</strong>. The good news? They are almost completely interchangeable and work on trains, subways, and buses throughout Japan, including cities like Osaka (ICOCA), Nagoya (manaca), Fukuoka (nimoca), and more.</p>
                            <p>Simply tap your card on the reader when you enter the ticket gate and tap again when you exit. The correct fare is deducted automatically. No more fumbling with cash or tickets!</p>
                            <p>You can get a physical "Welcome Suica" (valid for 28 days) at the airport or add a digital one to your phone's wallet.</p>

                     <!-- Section 3: Other Ways to Travel -->
                    <h3>Other Travel Options</h3>
                    <h4>Individual Shinkansen Tickets</h4>
                    <p>If a JR Pass isn't cost-effective for you, buying individual tickets is easy. You can purchase them at any JR ticket office or from a ticket machine. This is the best option if you're only making one or two long-distance trips.</p>

                    <h4>Highway Buses</h4>
                    <p>For the budget-conscious traveler, highway buses are a fantastic option. They are significantly cheaper than the Shinkansen, especially for overnight journeys which also save you a night's hotel stay. Willer Express and Japan Bus Online have English booking sites.</p>

                    <h4>Domestic Flights</h4>
                    <p>For very long distances, like traveling from Tokyo to Hokkaido or Okinawa, flying is often faster and cheaper than the train. Japan has several excellent low-cost carriers (LCCs) such as Peach, Jetstar Japan, and Skymark.</p>
