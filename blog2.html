            <div class="prose prose-lg mx-auto text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                <p class="mb-6">Look, a trip to Japan of course means a few key places – Tokyo and Kyoto especially. It’s called the Golden Route for a reason, and it’s great, but if you’ve done it before or you’re looking for something deeper, you’re missing out on one of the best parts of the country. For a more rewarding, less-touristy experience of Japan, you have to head north.</p>

                <h2>Tohoku: Rent a Car</h2>
                <p class="mb-6">I’m going to say this right away: rent a car. Seriously. The Shinkansen is fantastic for getting between the big cities like Sendai and Morioka, but it's useless for exploring the real Tohoku. The best stuff is hidden in the mountains and along the coasts, and driving gives you the freedom to find it all - the hidden onsens, ryokans, unknown temples and shrines, the stunning viewpoints you’d never see otherwise. It’s the only way to do it right.</p>

                <h2>A Prefecture-by-Prefecture Guide to Some of What’s Around</h2>
                <p class="mb-6">Tohoku is huge, so here's a quick rundown of some places I think are worth your time in each prefecture.</p>

                <h3>Fukushima</h3>
                <figure class="mb-6 rounded-lg overflow-hidden shadow-md">
                    <img src="images/toho5.jpg" onerror="this.onerror=null;this.src='https://placehold.co/800x450/6B7280/FFFFFF?text=Fukushima+Image';" alt="Fukushima landscape" class="w-full h-auto object-cover">
                    <figcaption class="text-center text-gray-500 text-sm mt-2">The beautiful landscapes of Fukushima.</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p class="mb-6">I’ve already written a post about my home turf, so I’ll keep it brief. Come for the epic, uncrowded snowboarding around Bandai, the history in Aizu, and the incredible food. It’s the perfect place to start your Tohoku adventure.</p>

                <h3>Miyagi</h3>
                <figure class="mb-6 rounded-lg overflow-hidden shadow-md">
                    <img src="images/toho1.jpg" onerror="this.onerror=null;this.src='https://placehold.co/800x450/6B7280/FFFFFF?text=Matsushima+Bay';" alt="Matsushima Bay, Miyagi" class="w-full h-auto object-cover">
                    <figcaption class="text-center text-gray-500 text-sm mt-2">Matsushima Bay, one of Japan's Three Great Views.</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p class="mb-4">The most famous spot is Matsushima Bay, one of Japan's "Three Great Views." You can take a cruise, but honestly, just rent a car or a scooter and drive the coastal road. The views are just as good, and you’re free. Then there's the Zao Fox Village. It’s not a trap, it's just... a weird experience. The sound of a hundred foxes screaming at you for food is surreal. You just walk freely among them.</p>
                <figure class="mb-6 rounded-lg overflow-hidden shadow-md">
                    <img src="images/foxes.jpg" onerror="this.onerror=null;this.src='https://placehold.co/800x450/6B7280/FFFFFF?text=Zao+Fox+Village';" alt="Zao Fox Village" class="w-full h-auto object-cover">
                    <figcaption class="text-center text-gray-500 text-sm mt-2">A unique encounter at Zao Fox Village.</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p class="mb-4">Also in the area is Zao mountain. It’s probably Japan's biggest single ski resort, but it's mostly gentle green and blue runs. The real reason to go is for the "snow monsters" – the giant, snow-covered trees at the peak are an incredible sight.</p>
                <figure class="mb-6 rounded-lg overflow-hidden shadow-md">
                    <img src="images/zaoview.jpg" onerror="this.onerror=null;this.src='https://placehold.co/800x450/6B7280/FFFFFF?text=Zao+Snow+Monsters';" alt="Zao snow monsters" class="w-full h-auto object-cover">
                    <figcaption class="text-center text-gray-500 text-sm mt-2">The impressive "snow monsters" of Zao mountain.</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p class="mb-6">Sendai, the main city, is mostly just your gateway – fly or train in, pick up your rental car, and get out into the real stuff.</p>

                <h3>Yamagata</h3>
                <p class="mb-6">First up is Yamadera, the temple on a cliff. The 1,000-step climb is tough but plenty of people do it, and the view from the ancient temple at the top is impressive. Then there’s Ginzan Onsen – yes, it is as beautiful as the photos make it out to be. The famous inns get booked up fast, but here's a tip: stay at one of the many other traditional onsens in the area. They're just as good, and just as historical. You can visit the famous street for a day trip and still have an amazing, authentic experience. Oh, and Yonezawa beef is delicious, and cherry picking (sakuranbo-gari) around June-July is a lot of fun.</p>

                <h3>Iwate</h3>
                <figure class="mb-6 rounded-lg overflow-hidden shadow-md">
                    <img src="images/toho3.jpg" onerror="this.onerror=null;this.src='https://placehold.co/800x450/6B7280/FFFFFF?text=Hiraizumi';" alt="Hiraizumi, Iwate" class="w-full h-auto object-cover">
                    <figcaption class="text-center text-gray-500 text-sm mt-2">The serene beauty of Hiraizumi.</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p class="mb-6">Head to Hiraizumi. The whole area is a UNESCO site, and it’s gorgeous. Don't just see the famous Golden Hall; drive around. The temple grounds are sweeping and beautiful, and you'll find smaller, historical shrines everywhere, set between quaint restaurants and rice fields.</p>

                <h3>Akita</h3>
                <figure class="mb-6 rounded-lg overflow-hidden shadow-md">
                    <img src="images/toho4.jpg" onerror="this.onerror=null;this.src='https://placehold.co/800x450/6B7280/FFFFFF?text=Akita+Roadside';" alt="Akita roadside station produce" class="w-full h-auto object-cover">
                    <figcaption class="text-center text-gray-500 text-sm mt-2">Fresh produce at a Michi no Eki in Akita.</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p class="mb-6">I’ve got one tip for Akita: stop at the Michi no Eki (roadside stations). We were driving through the mountains and bought huge boxes of apples and grapes for at least half the price you’d pay further south. It’s a perfect example of what makes a Tohoku road trip so good. [In fact – stop at Michi no Ekis everywhere when exploring!]</p>

                <h3>Aomori</h3>
                <p class="mb-6">I haven't explored Aomori properly yet – only had a decade! It’s famous for Nebuta festival, Oirase Gorge, Lake Towada, and Hirosaki Castle. It just proves there's always more to see here.</p>

                <h2>Tohoku's Summer Festivals</h2>
                <p class="mb-6">If you are visiting in early August, you’ll find some of Japan's best festivals. Of course, mid-August is Obon, so watch out for crowds then!</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-6 mb-6">
                    <li><strong>Aomori Nebuta Matsuri (around Aug 2-7):</strong> Massive, glowing warrior floats parade through the city. It’s loud and extremely famous.</li>
                    <li><strong>Akita Kanto Matsuri (around Aug 3-6):</strong> Performers balance huge poles of paper lanterns on their foreheads, shoulders, and hips.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sendai Tanabata Matsuri (around Aug 6-8):</strong> More chill, but beautiful. The city’s shopping arcades are filled with thousands of giant, colorful paper streamers.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Go Explore</h2>
                <p class="mb-6">Tohoku isn't as convenient as Tokyo, but the rewards are great. The whole region is huge, and honestly, you could make a vacation out of just one prefecture. So get off the tourist trail and go explore the real Japan.</p>
